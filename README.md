# Qt Python Arduino Serial interface

A cross-platform desktop application (using Qt for Python / C++ and Arduino) that enables serial communication between a PC and an Arduino device, with a GUI interface to monitor/send data.

## Features
- Serial-port communication between PC and Arduino (via USB/TTL).  
- Graphical user interface built with Qt (Python or C++ backend) to select port, baud rate, send and receive data.  
- Real-time monitoring of incoming serial data from Arduino.  
- Ability to send commands/data from PC to Arduino.  
- Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS and Linux (provided Qt and appropriate drivers are installed).  
- Simple architecture enabling extension with custom Arduino sketches and GUI controls.

## Architecture
This project consists of two main parts:

1. **Arduino Sketch**  
   An Arduino program uploaded to your Arduino board that reads from and writes to its serial port (USB).  
   It might handle e.g., sensors, actuators, commands via serial, or just echo input back for testing.

2. **PC GUI Application (Qt)**  
   The desktop application lets you select a serial port, configure communication parameters (baud rate, etc.), start monitoring the port, and send custom commands/data.  
   Internally the GUI uses Qtâ€™s serial port abstraction (or Python serial libraries) and socket/event handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano, or compatible) with USB serial interface.  
- Arduino IDE (for uploading the sketch).  
- A PC (Windows / macOS / Linux) with Python 3.x + PyQt5/6 (if using Python version) **or** Qt 5/6 + C++ toolchain (if using C++ version).  
- Serial-port drivers installed (especially on Windows for CH340/FTDI devices).  
- Git clone access to this repo.

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/qt-projects-python-cpp/qt-python-arduino-serial-interface.git
cd qt-python-arduino-serial-interface
